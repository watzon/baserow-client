# Baserow JavaScript Client

A comprehensive TypeScript client library for the [Baserow](https://baserow.io) API. This client provides a clean interface to interact with all aspects of the Baserow API from JavaScript environments, including Node.js, Bun, Deno, and the browser.

## Features

- üîÑ Full TypeScript support with comprehensive type definitions
- üîå Universal compatibility (Node.js, Bun, Deno, and browser environments)
- üß© Modular API with logical operation grouping
- üîê Built-in authentication handling
- üö¶ Proper error handling with detailed error information

## Installation

### Node.js

```bash
# Using npm
npm install baserow

# Using yarn
yarn add baserow

# Using pnpm
pnpm add baserow
```

### Bun

```bash
bun install baserow
```

### Deno

```typescript
// Import from npm registry in your script
import { BaserowClient } from "npm:baserow";
```

## Quick Start

```typescript
import { BaserowClient } from "baserow";

// Initialize the client
const client = new BaserowClient({
  url: "https://api.baserow.io",
  token: "YOUR_API_TOKEN",
  // Optional: tokenType defaults to "Token", can be "JWT" for JWT tokens
  tokenType: "Token",
});

// Basic example: Get workspace list
const workspaces = await client.workspace.getAll();
console.log(workspaces);

// Example: Create a row in a table
const newRow = await client.databaseRows.create(
  tableId, 
  { field_1: "Value 1", field_2: "Value 2" }
);
```

## API Structure

The client is organized into logical operation groups that match Baserow's API structure:

```typescript
// Health check operations
client.health.getFullHealthCheck();

// Admin operations
client.admin.getUserList();

// Workspace operations
client.workspace.getAll();

// Database row operations
client.databaseRows.getAll(tableId);
```
